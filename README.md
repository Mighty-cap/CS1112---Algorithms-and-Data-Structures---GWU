# CSCI 1112 — Data Structures & Algorithms

George Washington University · Java · Freshman year

Java implementations of core data structures and algorithms, written for CSCI 1112 at GWU. Each assignment folder has the source files and the original spec PDF.

## Assignments

| # | Topic | What's in it |
|---|-------|--------------|
| HW1 | Arrays & string manipulation | `TileGame` — Scrabble-like tile game using arrays and character utilities |
| HW2 | Sets & searching | `EmbeddedSet` — deciphering encoded messages by searching for embedded words in a cipher |
| HW3 | Sorting & searching | `ClassSchedule` — selection, bubble, and insertion sort + binary search on university schedule data; includes performance profiling |
| HW4 | Linked lists & array lists | `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` both implementing a `MusicCatalog` interface with `Song`/`CatalogItem` nodes — `add`, `remove`, `get`, `contains`, `clear`, `isEmpty` |
| HW5 | Stacks & queues | `Stack` and `Queue` implementations used to simulate bank `Account` transactions |
| HW6 | Maps & hash tables | `HashMap` (hash table) and `TreeMap` (BST) both implementing a `Map` interface — `put`, `get`, `delete` with performance analysis |

## Concepts covered

Arrays, string/character manipulation, set operations, sorting (selection, bubble, insertion — O(n²)), binary search O(log n), Big O analysis, singly linked lists, array-backed lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, hash tables, and map interfaces.

## Running the code

Each assignment compiles independently. From inside an assignment folder:

    javac *.java
    java UnitTests
